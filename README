tumblrrss.pl - a Tumblr "dashboard" RSS feed generator.

To set up, just drop the script in some directory on your web server,
change the variables under "config" to match your setup, and add the
scripts URL to your favourite feed reader.

Please make sure you're not hammering Tumblrs servers with a lot of
unneccesary requests.

DANGER WILL ROBINSON: This obviously makes something that was private
public. If you don't want anyone to see those, you should probably put this
script behind .htaccess protection or such.

Also, if anyone feels like making this print a little prettier, please go ahead.

Also, I don't want to hear any complaining about YOU CAN'T PARSE XML WITH
REGULAR EXPRESSIONS.
